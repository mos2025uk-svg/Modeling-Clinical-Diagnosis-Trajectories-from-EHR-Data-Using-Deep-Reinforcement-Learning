# Modeling-Clinical-Diagnosis-Trajectories-from-EHR-Data-Using-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning
Learning diagnostic pathways from electronic health records using deep reinforcement learning. The approach models patient journeys as sequential decision processes, capturing temporal relationships between symptoms, tests, and diagnoses to reveal clinically meaningful diagnostic trajectories and support data-driven decision analysis.
This project explores the use of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to automatically extract and model diagnosis pathways from Electronic Health Records (EHRs). The system learns sequential clinical decision patterns—such as symptom presentation, diagnostic tests, intermediate diagnoses, and final outcomes—by framing clinical progression as a Markov Decision Process.

Using longitudinal EHR data, the DRL agent is trained to identify optimal diagnostic trajectories that reflect real-world clinical practice. The learned pathways provide insights into common and atypical diagnostic flows, support clinical decision analysis, and enable downstream applications such as outcome prediction, care optimization, and guideline discovery.
